SineWave Text is a program that produces HTML for colored text.

(To get true rainbow text, check out my other program Rainbow Text.

This program works by drawing three sine waves (representing the red, blue, and green components of a color) with user-variable amplitude, frequency, and phase shifts.  Then the program iterates through 360 degrees taking the value of each wave at each degree and merging them to form a color value.

Credit goes to this site http://www.mu.org/~doug/blend/index.html for introducing me to the idea of producing gradients from sine and other shaped waves.
